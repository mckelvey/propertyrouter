## Property Router Overview

This plugin uses a Craft category to build dynamic routes for a property list template.

## Configuring Property Router

There isn’t a lot to configure unless you’re a dev. This would only be useful as a guide.

## Using Property Router

Once installed, the dynamic routes are available for use on the selected base path/template.

## Property Router Roadmap

There is no roadmap here. Unless there is some huge (and unexpected) upwelling of interest to provide configuration options here, this plugin will probably only receive maintenance releases.
